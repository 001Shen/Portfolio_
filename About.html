            <p>
                My name is Vonn, I am 20 years old, 
                and I am currently studying at the University Of SouthEastern Philippines. 
                I took the course BSIT under the major of Business Technology and Management. 
                Since I was young, I had always been fond of technology and how things work behind the scenes. 
                I love designing and that is why I hope to be a UI/UX Designer someday!
